CS255 DrivePass Documents


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    
    DrivePass is a business that provides on the road training and online lessions/test prep for individuals preparing to get their drivers license.
    The company was founded by Liam.  Liam, along with his IT Admin Ian, requested an online system that allowed for, at minimum:
        -Users to purchase training packages
        -Schedule, modify, or cancel appointments
        -Keep track of user progress
        -Download reports for offline use
        -Basic user security features
        -See updated DMV requirements
        
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    With this project I feel that I broke down the interview with Liam and Ian to create the different requirement documents particularly well. 
    There was a lot of information provided in that interview that was important for functional and non-functional requirements, as well as in
    creating the UML class diagram.  For example, Liam mentioned that the staff would take the customer's information over the phone and create the
    initial user profile.  This can be shown in the class diagram by a relation line of "implements" or "establishes".
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    If I were to revise one part of these documents it would be the Use Case Model.  I believe that I could have made it more indepth, providing more
    uses or relations.  Information that I may have missed on my read through during the creation of that model would need to be added.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are ultimately who will be using the system.  If a user has a bad experience
    or is unable to meet their own needs when using the system, they will likely decide to go elsewhere to reach their goal.  With DrivePass the users
    break down into Staff, Instructors, IT Admin, and Customers.  Each type of user will have their own goals.  Staff will want to log in, view reports,
    and update new customer information.  Admin will want to set roles, reset accounts, and restrict unauthorized access.  Instructors will want to provide
    feedback on lessons and see appointment information.  Students will want to modify their information, purchase packages, take lessons, schedule and modify
    appointments, and set up any special requirements.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    
    When designing software I start from the provided requirements.  From there I brainstorm on how those requirements can be met and how to implement those
    methods.  This builds a rough outline to build upon when researching or writing code.  The use of UML diagrams in the future will help in building these
    outlines.  Also, the use of a BRD will provide a standardized format for futurue requirement lists.
